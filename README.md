## Aws EC2 setup
EC2 > Instances > Launch instances 

 <img src="https://github.com/Pyncro/Portfolio-with-AWS/blob/main/img/lancerinstance.png">

Choose Ubuntu 20.04 as it's the one that has the least issues with dependancies.

Proceed the steps as normal and choose the t2.micro on Step 2 (which is the free tier).
 
On step 6 open the port to anywhere to allow all entrance to the IP host.Afterwards on step 7 create/or choose a key pair for ubuntu and then launch the instance.


Left click on the instance and view what security group it's attached to. (ex:wizard-x)

## FTP - ssh
Everything is done now with AWS , now you can connect to your ubuntu server.To do this , look into your EC2's ip address additional information , it shows you how to connect to it via ssh. (ex: ssh -i "portfolio.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com)

To connect to it via FTP , you must first give chmod 400 of the permission key

Afterwards you must integrate permissions key to your FTP.


## Ubuntu setup
```sudo apt get update && upgrade```

```sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php mysql-server php-mysql```

```sudo systemctl apache2 status```

## Finalized result
the www directory is now created , download a template from materialize and then paste it in /var/www/html (note that there's an index.html by default and that it has to be removed.)

everytime you upload/update a file in this directory , perform a ```sudo systemctl apache2 restart```
